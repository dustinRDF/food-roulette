# Food Roulette

**Goal:** 
Produce a MEAN stack web application that will integrate the google maps API to pull restaraunt information in an area, display them on a map, and randomly choose a place to eat based on user defined constraints. (ie. price, distance, custom list, etc...)

**Features:**
- Display restaraunts within a given radius of the users location
- Display information about those restaraunts in a list (ie price, distance, type, rating, etc...)
- Randomly choose restaraunt for the user
- Store user restaraunt history and experience
